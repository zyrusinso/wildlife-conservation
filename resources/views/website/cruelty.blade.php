                        Animal cruelty can take many different forms, as you’ll discover below, but the impact is <br/>always the same. A sentient animal capable of love and creating social relationships <br/>experience pain, fear, and desperation. And it needs to stop.<br/><br/>

                        We live in a world that not only turns a blind eye to animal cruelty but condones it — <br/>whether through indifference or legislation. It’s legal to raise chickens in deplorable <br/>conditions for the sole purpose of slaughtering them later. If that isn’t animal cruelty, <br/>then what is?<br/><br/>

                        The problem is that there aren’t enough people fighting for animal rights. If everyone <br/>started to look at animals — and not just dogs and cats — as fellow animals who share <br/>our planet, we would see far fewer cases of cruelty toward animals.<br/><br/>

                        First, though, we have to spread awareness. What is animal cruelty? What does it look <br/>like? And how can we stop contributing to it?<br/><br/>

                        <b style="float: left;">What is Animal Cruelty?</b><br/><br/>

                        Animal cruelty is the abuse toward or neglect of an animal. It’s that simple. Some <br/>aspects of animal cruelty involve purposefully putting animals in situations that harm<br/>, scare, and terrorize them, while others simply result from people looking the other way.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Most animal cruelty investigations involve large-scale operations that victimize hundreds <br/>or thousands of animals at a time. For instance, the SPCA frequently goes undercover <br/>at factory farming operations to expose the cruel conditions in which farmed animals live.<br/><br/>

                        However, animal cruelty takes place every day in all places, not just in the world <br/>of industrial animal agriculture. It might be happening inside your neighbor’s house, at <br/>an entertainment venue in your city, or at a lab near where you work. You’ve likely <br/>encountered stray animals throughout your life — companion animals who have been <br/>abandoned and left to fend for themselves.<br/><br/>

                        Cases of animal cruelty fall into several categories. Let’s explore them in more detail.<br/><br/>
                        
                        <b style="float: left;">Animal Abuse</b><br/><br/>
                        
                        Most cases of animal abuse involve the willful harming of a nonhuman animal. When a <br/>man kicks a dog for having an accident in the house or when a woman whips her horse <br/>for failing to respond to a command, those are instances of animal abuse.<br/><br/>

                        One of the problems facing animal rights activists is that animal abuse rarely occurs in <br/>plain view. It happens behind closed doors and in factory farms that aren’t open to the <br/>public. When we don’t see it occur, we can pretend it doesn’t exist.<br/><br/>

                        Unfortunately for the affected animals, it does exist. Animal cruelty and abuse is a <br/>systemic problem that often gets handed down from parent to child, boss to worker, and <br/>culture to culture.<br/><br/>

                        There’s a reason most jurisdictions have animal control officers. These members of law <br/>enforcement bravely investigate cases of animal abuse, prosecute the offenders, and <br/>rescue the animals. However, they’re only effective when someone reports the abuse.<br/><br/>

                        <b style="float: left;">Animal Neglect</b><br/><br/>
                        
                        In some cases, animal neglect stems from ignorance. A person keeps an animal on his <br/>or her property and doesn’t know how to properly care for that animal. This isn’t a <br/>justification for the neglect, but a recognition that we need to educate people about the <br/>animals in their care.<br/><br/>

                        Neglect can also stem from disinterest. If a dog owner notices that the animal has <br/>sustained an injury, he or she is morally and legally obligated to obtain veterinary care. <br/>Unfortunately, some people are unwilling to spend the time and money necessary to <br/>heal their sick or injured pets.<br/><br/>

                        Similarly, a companion animal might go days or weeks without food because the owner <br/>“just forgets.” That’s not an excuse. Every day, emaciated, diseased, flea-ridden <br/>animals enter shelters. Some get adopted by loving families. Others aren’t so lucky.<br/><br/>

                        Worse, some animals spend their entire lives in neglectful circumstances. They <br/>eventually die of dehydration, malnutrition, untreated diseases, or other conditions.<br/><br/>

                        <b style="float: left;">Animal Exploitation</b><br/><br/>

                        For some people, there’s a sense of entitlement toward animals. These people believe <br/>that we have the right to use animals in any way we wish, usually for monetary gain. <br/>Exploiting animals is a form of animal cruelty, however, especially when the exploitation <br/>goes against the animal’s instincts or forces the animal into scary or unsafe situations.<br/><br/>

                        Circuses, zoos, aquatic theme parks, and other venues often exploit animals in the <br/>name of entertainment. The crowds don’t see how the animals are forced into <br/>submission, kept in tiny cages, and denied socialization with others of their own <br/>species. <br/><br/>

                        Did you know that 96 percent of a circus animal’s life is spent in a cage? They’re <br/>transported from city to city in trailers that lack climate control, and they often use <br/>barbaric devices to force performances, from bullwhips and chains to cattle prods.<br/><br/>

                        Even zoos, which are often viewed as positive contributions to a community, have been <br/>rife with animal cruelty. Zoo animal abuse can take many forms, from starving animals <br/>to sending them to livestock options. This doesn’t even take into account the many <br/>accidents that have occurred due to poorly constructed exhibits.<br/><br/>

                        <b style="float: left;">Human Predation</b><br/>

                        Human beings are often called “apex predators.” Because of our unique skill set, we <br/>can dominate animals easily. The question is whether we should — and the answer <br/>is no.<br/><br/>

                        When humans prey on animals, we take away their agency and reduce them to nothing <br/>but food on a plate. Sometimes, we even prey on animals without the desire <br/>to eat them. The fur farming industry is one solid example.<br/><br/>

                        There’s no reason for humans to prey on animals. Endless cases of animal cruelty <br/>come from factory farming, hunting, and fishing.<br/><br/>

                        Consider, for instance, that anyone can get a hunting license. There’s no test to find out <br/>of they can shoot straight. Every year, hunters maim animals with non-lethal shots, <br/>which means those animals die slow, excruciating deaths.<br/><br/>
                        
                        <b style="float: left;">Animal Testing</b><br/>

                        We’ve been testing products on animals for many decades, and even though our <br/>scientific developments have rendered animal testing unnecessary — and even less <br/>effective than other testing methods — it still occurs all around the world.<br/><br/>

                        Animals in testing facilities are exposed to all manner of chemicals and substances, <br/>many of which cause itching, burning, chronic pain, lost body parts, and other terrible <br/>consequences. The animal cruelty that pervades laboratories doesn’t need to continue.<br/><br/>

                        Imagine spending your entire life confined to a hospital bed — one that has no mattress <br/>or blankets. You’re constantly receiving “treatments” that cause discomfort, and you <br/>can’t have any visitors.<br/><br/>

                        That’s a close analogy to the animal cruelty involved in laboratory testing.
